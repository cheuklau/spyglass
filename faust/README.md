# Faust

## Introduction

[Faust](https://github.com/robinhood/faust) is a Python stream processing library similar to Kafka Streams. Faust supports both stream processing and event processing. We will use Faust to calculate intraday stock metrics on-the-fly e.g., [intraday volatility measures](https://eranraviv.com/intraday-volatility-measures/).
